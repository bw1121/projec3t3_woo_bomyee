			   			</p>
			   			<p>He grew to fame when his longtime friend landed a show called &lsquo;Horsin&rsquo; Around&rsquo; and casted him as the star of the show. The sitcom centered around a young bachelor horse (BoJack) raising three orphans. </p>
			   			<p>After the show ended, BoJack entered a period where he did not take any roles in the entertainment industry. However, in the 2000s, he started working with ghost writer Diane to write a biography about his life.</p>
			   			<p>The book was a hit and it allowed him to be casted in his long-awaited dream in playing Secretariat. BoJack hopes to become someone greater than just &ldquo;the horse from &lsquo;Horsin&rsquo; Around&rsquo;&rdquo;. He longs to become an award-winning actor playing deep, serious roles in the future.</p>
